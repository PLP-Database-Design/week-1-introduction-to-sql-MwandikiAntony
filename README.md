# SQL Assignment Week 1


## **Assignment Questions**

1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
- Database Engine: Manages data storage and retrieval.
- Database Schema: Defines the structure and relationships of the data.
- Query Processor: Interprets and executes SQL queries.
- Transaction Manager: Ensures data integrity during transactions.
- Data Dictionary: Stores metadata about database objects.

2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
- A relational database is a database that stores data in tables with rows and columns.

Examples include:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server

3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
- Data Manipulation Language: Used for querying and modifying data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT).
- Data Definition Language: Defines database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER).
- Data Control Language: Manages permissions (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
- Primary Key niquely identifies each record in a table while Foreign Key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.

5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
- It is a visual representation of entities and their relationships in a database.

6. What are the advantages of relational databases?
- Data Integrity: Ensures data accuracy and consistency with constraints like primary and foreign keys.
- Query Flexibility: SQL allows complex queries to manipulate and retrieve data.
- Scalability: Handles large data volumes and can scale both vertically and horizontally.
- Security: Provides user authentication, role-based access, and encryption.
- Normalization: Reduces data redundancy, improving efficiency.

7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
- INT (integer)
- VARCHAR (variable-length string)
- DATE (date)
- FLOAT (floating-point number)
   
8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)? 
- A DBMS manages and organizes data, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data while maintaining data integrity and security.
